## Project Overview
This project presents an analysis of a bike sales dataset to uncover insights into customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, and income patterns. It was completed using Excel for data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboard creation, enabling clear visual summaries of key findings. This analysis can assist stakeholders in understanding factors influencing bike sales.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies and missing data. This cleaned data is stored in the "bike_buyers" sheet for visualization and further analysis.
2. **Pivot Table Creation**: Using the cleaned data, multiple pivot tables were generated to analyze:
   - Average income per purchase status
   - Customer commute patterns
   - Customer age brackets and purchasing habits
3. **Dashboard Development**: A "Bike Sales Dashboard" was created to summarize key insights, helping to visualize relationships between various factors, such as income, age, and purchasing status.

## Visualizations and Insights
The pivot tables and dashboard include visualizations of:
- **Income vs. Bike Purchase**: Average income by customers who purchased a bike.
- **Commute Distance**: Breakdown of commuting distances and how they relate to bike purchases.
- **Age Brackets**: Customer age groups and their purchasing tendencies.

## How to Use This Project
